# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page solution
This is a solution to the  
[Notifications page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC). 

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

- My approach is Mobile-first as it is easy to maintain element positioning afterwards.
- I created an object and store all the messages by creating object array.
- All messages are splited into parts which are common in all messages.
- Than uses js to render all messages on webpage by using createElement().
- Add a eventlistener to notification tabs to update the unseen messages counter.
